	 * Frustums can be thought of as volumes in the shape of a pyramid, but the
	 * tip is chopped off, so you get a 6-sided shape similar to a box, but the
	 * corners don't meet at right angle.  These are most often used to represent
	 * a camera's field of vision, and projection matrices are based on the idea
	 * of warping this space into a box that does have right angles.  This warping
	 * of the space is what gives us the fore-shortening effect; which is the effect
	 * that things further away appear smaller, and things closer, bigger.
	 * 
	 * The frustums represented by this class can very in shape, but not position
	 * and orientation.  Specifically, these frustums always have the tip of their
	 * pyramid at the origin, and the base goes toward the -Z axis.  In other words,
	 * these are always camera-space frustums.  If you want to check to see if a
	 * world space object intersects a frustum, then you need to transform that
	 * object into camera space first.
