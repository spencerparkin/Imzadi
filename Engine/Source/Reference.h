	 * This is the base class for any dynamically allocated class that we would like to
	 * reference count.  Be careful not to inherit this class more than once.  I try to
	 * avoid multiple inheritance, but if it is done, use virtual inheritance to make
	 * sure that only one of these is inherited.  Otherwise, you could get a double-delete.
	 *
	 * This class works in conjunction with the Reference class.
	 *
	 * Note that it is possible to create a memory leak by creating a direct or indirect
	 * circular reference.  No attempt is made here to catch or detect circular references.
	 * You can use handles instead of references to deal with the problem of circular references.
	 * Compare this mechanism to that of std::weak_ptr<>.
	 *
	 * Note that this class and the Reference class *should* be thread-safe.  I added
	 * thread-safety as an after-thought and now only time will tell if it really is safe.
	 * Only the very wise can see all ends, as Gandolf would say.  Sigh...I have my doubts.
	 * 
	 * I don't recommend creating and destroying reference-counted objects every frame,
	 * if you can help it.  There is some overhead in the construction and destruction
	 * of these objects that could add up to a significant performance hit.
