	 * This collision shape is a polygon determined by a sequence of object-space points
	 * and an object-to-world transform.  All points must be coplanar, and they must form
	 * a convex polygon.  If these constraints are not satisfied, then the results of using
	 * this shape for collision purposes are all left undefined.  (Intermediate uses of
	 * this class may contain point sequences that do not necessarily satisfy these constraints.)
	 * The winding of the polygon will not matter as far as collision detection is concerned.
	 * However, the correctness of many operations requires that we consider the "front" space of
	 * the polygon to be where, if you viewed the polygon from this place, you'd see its points
	 * wound CCW.  The "back" space is where you would view the polygon's points wound clock-wise.
	 * A "thickness" of the polygon is necessary for some calculations.
	 * 
	 * Note that the point-sequence is considered cyclical.  Modular arithematic
	 * is often used to index into this sequence.  The polygon in world space
	 * is found by applying an object-to-world transform to the point-sequence.
