/**
 * This is the main interface to the collision system.  An application will typically instantiate
 * just one of these for its purposes, but it could instantiate more.  A single instance manages
 * a collection of collidable shapes in a given pre-defined region.  Users can send commands to
 * reposition or reorient the shapes, and make queries to, for example, see what shapes a given
 * shape is in collision with.  This interface is designed to be asynchronous with the hope that
 * efficiency is gained through parallelism.
 * 
 * See the GetError function for error handling and error information.
 * 
 * Note that the collision system does not resolve collisions or satisfy constraints based on
 * any kind of physics-based simulation.  Those details are left to the user.  Our only goal
 * here is to facilitate the complex problem of collision detection.  Physics is a seperate
 * problem.
