	 * Derivatives of this class represent all the kinds of shapes that the collision system supports.
	 * These are all the shapes that can collide with one another.  A shape is described in object
	 * space and is found in world space using an object-to-world transform.  The whole point of the
	 * collision system is to let the user create shapes in the world, move them around, and query
	 * to see which are in collision with which other shapes, and how.
	 * 
	 * Note that users create these on the main thread and then hand them over to the collision thread.
	 * The time until the shapes are handed over is the only time the user can directly mutate the shape.
	 * Once it's handed over, the user can only safely refer to a shape by ID, and can only safely mutate
	 * that shape indirectly through the use of collision system commands.
	 * 
	 * For now, only convex collision shapes are supported, but there is no requirement that this be
	 * the case in the overall design of the system.  An arbitrary mesh that is not necessarily convex
	 * would be the most flexible type of collision shape I can think of, but is presently well beyond
	 * the capabilities of this system.

	 * we let the world-to-object transform always be a function of that truth.  This way,
	 * we're never uncertain about what is current and what is possibly not.  If both
