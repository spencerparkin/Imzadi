TODO:
====
[x] Fix moving platform frictionlessness bug.
[ ] Fix jumping bug where sometimes you jump higher than usual.
[ ] Fix bug where character doesn't always land smoothly from a jump.  Need to constrain velocity as well as position?
[x] Fix falling through platform randomly bug.
[x] Fix render glitch bugs on character.
[x] Get character animation working (even if it's mediocre like everything else.)
[x] Refactor entire repository into a game engine and game app.  Rename the repo "GameEngine" or something like that.
[x] Refine the asset tools/pipeline, because it's a bit of a mess.  Can we actually get a rigged/animated character flowing into the engine?  Look at the AssImp library.
[ ] Port engine to DX12.  (I started to do this, then decided it wasn't a good idea.  It's too much work.)
[ ] Add audio support with direct sound or XAudio2?  Can we do spatial-awareness/3D sounds?
[ ] The run animation should be sped-up/slowed-down based on the character's velocity.
[ ] Add another character, but this time an NPC that you can interact with.  May need to refactor some code for this.  Can we do path-following?
[ ] Add another level.  How do we handle smooth level transition?
[/] Would be neat to add cube-mapping with dynamic reflections.  (I added a sky-box, but am not yet doing any environment/reflection mapping.)
[x] Need to add MIP-mapping.  All textures have just one MIP right now.
[ ] Networking support with proxy entities?
[ ] Add trigger-boxes for teleports and level transitions.  I'm thinking levels should be connected in a graph, non-linearly.  That is, you can go from level X to level Y wherever they're connected.  Ultimately, you're trying to bring the chalice back to Luwaxana.
[ ] Add zip-lines.  Must hold down a button to hang on and release the button to let go.  Need to add zip-line hanging animation.
[ ] Landing with too much velocity should kill you.  Need to add fatal-fall-death animation.
